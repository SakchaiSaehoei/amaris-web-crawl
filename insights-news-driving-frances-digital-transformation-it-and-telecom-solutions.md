## **Listen to Mathias’ journey: an Experienced Manager**
Graduated from Télécom Saint-Etienne in France, Mathias joined us in 2022 as an intern and is now an Experienced Manager, leading a team of 20 consultants in the IT and Telecom sectors.
Mathias shares: “I knew nothing about the job initially, so I had to learn by doing. I was also well-supported by my manager. This put me in the right position to learn and discover a lot. I think this applies to people at all levels, with any amount of experience. Whether you have zero or twenty years of experience, you will still learn new things. It’s all about having the right mindset to learn and explore new topics.”
