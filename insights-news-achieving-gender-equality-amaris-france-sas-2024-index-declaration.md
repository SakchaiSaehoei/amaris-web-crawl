# Achieving Gender Equality: Amaris France SAS 2024 Index Declaration
In alignment with the Law of September 5th, 2018, on the freedom to choose oneâ€™s professional future, Amaris Consulting France entity proudly presents the outcomes of our Gender Equality Index declaration for the year 2024, derived from data from 2023. Encompassing provisions aimed at ensuring professional equality between women and men, this law mandates that companies with more than 50 employees annually publish an indicator addressing pay gaps and the corresponding strategies employed for their elimination.
The Gender Equality Index, a comprehensive framework established by law, evaluates various indicators to assign a score out of 100 points. This score serves not only as a benchmark for companies but also acts as a catalyst for identifying areas of improvement and the strategic levers to advance workplace equality.
## **Our results**
**Gender pay gap** : 39/40
**Salary Increase rate gap** : 20/20
**Promotion rate gap:** 15/15
**Percentage of female employees receiving a raise after maternity leave** : 15/15
**Number of employees of the under-represented gender among the 10 highest earners:** 5/10
## **Our Total Score: 94 out of 100**
We are thrilled to announce our overall score of 94 out of 100 points on the Gender Equality Index. This accomplishment not only celebrates our achievements but also propels us forward on our journey toward greater diversity and equality.
