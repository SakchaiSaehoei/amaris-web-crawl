# Health economics modelling
**Amaris is a trusted partner with a stellar reputation for conducting health economic evaluations. Our team of health economists experts has an in-depth knowledge of research methods, combined with extensive consulting experience. We provide reliable and highly credible results to our clients. Our models are user-friendly, transparent, quality-checked, and based on the most current and scientifically rigorous methods. Our models are regularly used to support reimbursement submissions and payer negotiations.**
We enjoy a stellar reputation for both building and adapting health economic models. This makes us a reliable go-to partner for the creation of cost-effectiveness and budget impact models for national and regional reimbursement authorities and healthcare providers as well as to inform strategic decisions. Our models are regularly used to support reimbursement submissions, demonstrating the high-quality work that our team delivers.
## We have an established track record in developing:
### Epidemiological models
  * Target population forecasts
  * Estimating natural history of disease for patients and populations
  * Infectious disease models
  * Impact of new intervention


### Early modelling
  * Go/no go decisions
  * Heat maps
  * Gap analysis
  * Pricing scenarios


### Cost-effectiveness modelling
  * Evaluations of interventions comparing costs and outcomes
  * Decision trees, Markov models, discrete event simulation, cohort/microsimulations, dynamic models


### Budget impact modelling
  * Evaluating affordability of an intervention for national and local payers


### Model adaptations
  * Adapting models using local data
  * Understanding of local requirements
  * HTA submission/payer communication support


## Focus on one type of project: Here is how we would typically conduct a cost-effectiveness health economics model development
### Step 1: Review of evidence and data collection
  * Review evidence related to health technology/program of interest to understand key impact
  * Conduct systematic or targeted reviews (depending on context) related to efficacy/safety, quality of life, healthcare resource use/costs, and health economic studies
  * Conduct targeted review on the clinical guidelines, management practices, and epidemiology of disease
  * Highlight key treatment differentiators
  * Outline implications for modelling based on the development of a model framework
  * Validate findings with clinical experts


### Step 2: Model specifications
  * Develop a model specification document describing the following:
  * Target population
  * Intervention & comparators
  * Model structure
  * Model parameters: progression of disease, estimation of treatment effect, costs, outcomes
  * Model outcomes
  * Scenario and sensitivity analyses (univariate, multivariate, probabilistic)
  * Methods for model validation
  * The model specifications are presented to internal and/or external experts to validate the methodological approach and the main assumptions


### Step 3: Model development
  * Develop the model in Excel, R, or other software depending on the model specificities, in line with specifications
  * Quality control: test model by independent modeler and according to the Amaris SOP to ensure structural integrity is intact


### Step 4: Results presentation and documentation
  * Report to include details on:
    * Study objectives
    * Methods (model structure, population, parametrization detail, etc.)
    * Results (base case, sensitivity, threshold analyses)
    * Validation: comparison vs clinical trials, RWE, and model corroboration
    * Discussion
    * Conclusion


### Step 5: Publication
  * Prepare abstracts for presentation at scientific conferences
  * Develop manuscripts to be published in peer reviewed journals


## Our worldwide experience in building and adapting health economic models spans the following regions:
  * USA and Canada
  * Across the European Union
  * Latin America
  * Asia-Pacific
  * Middle East


## We believe that the following elements are our key success factors when performing health economic modelling studies
  1. **A multi-disciplinary team:** Health economists, statisticians, clinical analysts/health care professionals, and market access specialists are working hand in hand on our projects
  2. **Strategic insight:** We understand treatment differentiators and can identify a key audience and their expectations
  3. **Robust and efficient methods:** Robust data collection methods and analytics, deep understanding of official guidance (e.g. DSU), and collaboration with experts from academia
  4. **Model validation step:** Reproduction of observed data, extreme scenario testing, program review, sensitivity analyses, validated SOPs
  5. **Compliant documentation:** model specifications validated prior to model development, technical report in line with relevant guidelines ([HTA](https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Health-systems/health-technologies-and-medicines/policy-areas/health-technology-assessment), [ICER](https://icer.org/), etc.), and user guides


### Other reasons to work with us:
  * Our health economics models are user-friendly, built transparently, and based on the latest and most scientifically rigorous methods.
  * We have the capability to create models that are interactive and that you can bring with you everywhere you go (e.g. tablet applications, web-based platforms).
  * We are with you every step of the way: we can train your teams on how to use the tools we create (face to face or virtually, from people with no prior experience to experts)
  * We adjust our language to make sure that even the most complex of techniques are understood clearly.
