**European eprObes Week for Early Prevention of Obesity**. ‘** _Parents as Health Architects: Key Players for Early Obesity Prevention_****’**
**Paris, 28 February 2025** – From 4 to 11 March 2025, the European eprObes Week for Early Prevention of Obesity will take place, bringing together experts, policymakers, leading institutions, and health advocates to address one of the most urgent public health challenges: childhood obesity. Organised under the eprObes project (Early Prevention of Obesity in European Society), this week will shine a spotlight on the crucial role parents play in shaping healthy habits for their children from an early age.
With a €10 million budget and a five-year duration, the eprObes project unites 21 organisations across Europe to develop and promote evidence-based strategies for preventing obesity in early life. The project underscores the importance of interventions that start during pregnancy and continue through childhood and adolescence, aiming to reduce the risk of obesity and its associated health issues.
Amaris Consulting is proud to be part of the eprObes consortium. As a key contributor, Amaris Consulting is responsible for developing AI models focused on obesity, including the identification of development trajectories and the recommendation of effective prevention strategies. Additionally, Amaris is leading the development of a digital platform to support real-time decision-making for obesity intervention strategies.
### **European Workshop in Brussels: A Key Event for Policy and Science**
The European eprObes Week will kick off with a high-level European Workshop in Brussels on 4 March 2025. This event will feature representatives from the European Commission and esteemed international experts. The workshop will provide a forum for discussing policy recommendations, scientific breakthroughs, and practical approaches to support parents in fostering healthier environments for their children, ultimately preventing obesity.
Prof. Dr. Manuel Tena-Sempere, coordinator of the eprObes project from CIBER in Spain, highlights the significance of early intervention: “Parents play a critical role in shaping their children’s health, even before birth. The prenatal and early childhood years offer crucial opportunities to lay the foundation for lifelong health. By equipping parents with the right knowledge and resources, we empower them to become proactive health architects, guiding their children from the prenatal stage through to puberty.”
_Amaris Consulting_ will actively participate in the European Workshop with its team of researchers, including Atanasov Petar, Neff-Baro Shanti, Bravo Serrano Alex, and Talas Yassine.
The European Workshop is also supported by OBEClust, the European Cluster of Obesity Research Projects. Comprising nine European projects and mobilising over €70 million, OBEClust aims to create a multidisciplinary network of experts in obesity prevention, strengthening the methods, outputs, and impact of EU-funded obesity research.
