# Green IT
Technology companies have a crucial role to play on the path to net-zero. The environmental footprint of the IT sector is growing exponentially with a potential of increasing 50% impact in the next 5 years, emitting almost 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This generates the current trend for focusing not only on developing faster and more powerful devices, but also on implementing efficient green computing strategies to mitigate their environmental impact.
The cultural shift towards sustainability remains a large challenge for the IT sector due to the growing demand of electronics and the soaring price of energy. Key initiatives such as device management, virtualization, power management and mutualization of computing resources are being taken by businesses to maintain their reputations and stay relevant.
