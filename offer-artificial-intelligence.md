# Artificial Intelligence
Successfully completing a digital transformation requires a well-founded data strategy and execution plan, driven by multidisciplinary teams that combine business insight with technical expertise across **data engineering, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), cloud development, user experience and data visualization.**
## **The importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
Data science and AI can be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of internal operations, as well as facilitating and improving companies’ data-driven decision-making abilities.
Supported by the right data architecture, tools, and data governance processes, AI and data science have the power to revolutionize business operations; from better customer understanding to the identification of weak points and inefficiencies, as well as reducing human error and enabling enhanced forecasting.
