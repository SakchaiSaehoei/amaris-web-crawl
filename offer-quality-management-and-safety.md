# Quality management and Safety
Quality and safety represent increasingly important concerns in the product lifecycle. The more complex the product, the greater the need for them to be safe, reliable, and well-regulated.
Ensuring compliance in today’s rapidly changing regulatory landscape is a must, but organizations should not think of quality and safety as a liability. Rather, it’s an incredible opportunity for cost savings and business success.
