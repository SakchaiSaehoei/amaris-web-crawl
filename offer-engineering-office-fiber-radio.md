# Engineering Office: Fiber Network, Radio Network Coverage & Design (Low Level Design)
Now that 5G is set for commercial availability, innovation in engineering is inevitable. With a unique combination of high-speed connectivity, low latency, and ubiquitous coverage, 5G promises new opportunities for businesses from different industries.
However, communication service providers (CSPs) now have the challenge of successfully setting up 5G infrastructure from scratch without incurring extremely high infrastructure costs. They require a denser and fiber-rich infrastructure and better radio network coverage to be able to deliver improved speed, ultra-low latency, and better quality of service. Implementing this will help CSPs surpass competitors and reap the full benefits of this technology.
To deploy this type of technology on an industrial scale, it is necessary to be able to provide quality LLDs that can be relied upon.
