## The 3 pillars of the Manager role
Becoming a Manager at Amaris Consulting means taking on multiple responsibilities at once, making each day unique and exciting. The role revolves around three main axes:
##### Business: being a driver of growth
As a Manager, you’re not just following ongoing projects; you’re initiating them. You become a true leader of growth for the clients you manage. This involves identifying new opportunities, offering innovative solutions, and helping clients thrive.
Loïc, now an Experienced Manager, describes his daily mission: “ _My role is to develop the business with my clients by identifying their specific needs and launching new projects. I’m based in Paris and work with French companies , which allows me to meet clients regularly, understand their challenges, and anticipate their demands. This proximity helps me create closeness between consultants and clients’ needs, so I can always stay proactive_.”
Business development is essential, as it allows you to create value for the client while aligning internal resources, especially consultants, with project goals. You will also be responsible for the profitability of your projects.

##### Finance : ensuring project profitability
The second pillar is Finance, essential for developing your business unit. This involves managing costs, ensuring project profitability, and maximizing revenue from the services provided. As a Manager, you need to ensure that projects are not only delivered efficiently but also generate positive financial results for the company.
Loïc explains: “ _Profitability is crucial as the company finances its projects. We implement strict cost management to ensure the sustainability of our activities, closely monitoring expenses and optimizing resources. Collaborating with clients to demonstrate the ROI of our services strengthens their satisfaction and trust, allowing us to maintain financial balance while supporting our consultants and meeting client expectations._ “
At Amaris Consulting, management extends beyond simple oversight; it includes actively engaging in the financial performance of your projects, ensuring that you and your team work efficiently to achieve financial targets.

When we build strong relationships, we set ourselves up for sustainable growth._ ”

##### **Recruitment & Management: building and supporting your consultant team**
At Amaris Consulting, a Manager is not just responsible for overseeing projects; they also play a key role in building, leading, and supporting their team of consultants. This includes actively participating in the recruitment process, where you’ll source, evaluate, and integrate top candidates while leading your team in their projects. The management aspect is crucial, as you will need to ensure your team has the right projects and supports their career paths.
Gaël, currently a Manager in Lille, shares his experience: “ _My team is composed of 13 consultants. One of the most rewarding aspects of the Manager role is seeing your team take shape. I’m 100% involved in recruitment, directly searching for candidates on job boards and social media. This part of the job is highly strategic because the quality of your projects depends on the people you recruit.”_
Chloé, who recently started as a Manager role in Paris, shares: “ _I love the idea of guiding my consultants in their careers and helping them reach their full potential. Right now, I’m still building my team, but I’m eager to put my leadership skills to work to help them grow_.”
