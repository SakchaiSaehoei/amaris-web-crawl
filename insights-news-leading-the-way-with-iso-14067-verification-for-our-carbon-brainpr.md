We are excited to announce a significant milestone for Amaris Consulting: our internally developed Carbon Brainprint tool has achieved ISO 14067 verification. This accomplishment underscores our unwavering commitment to sustainability and solidifies our position as pioneers in environmental responsibility within the consulting industry.
## What is ISO 14067?
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops global standards to transform scientific knowledge into practical tools for combating climate change. ISO 14067, part of the ISO 14060 family, provides guidelines for the quantification, monitoring, reporting, and verification of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals. Specifically, ISO 14067 focuses on the carbon footprint of products and services, ensuring accurate and reliable carbon emissions calculations.
## Carbon Brainprint: innovation in action
Carbon Brainprint is an innovative tool developed by Mantu, the group to which Amaris Consulting belongs, to accurately calculate the carbon footprint of the intellectual services we provide to our clients. Unlike currently used methods that estimate carbon emissions based on monetary ratios (e.g., the ADEME emissions factors for consulting services of 110 kg CO2e/€1k spent), our tool performs a physical analysis of carbon emissions. This precise methodology offers better visibility into the real impact across the project lifecycle and provides opportunities to rethink project elements to reduce the overall carbon footprint.
## Verified success in business cases
The ISO 14067 verification includes an assurance statement for the Amaris Consulting 2024 calculator and two business cases where Carbon Brainprint has already been deployed. This verification not only confirms the accuracy of our tool but also highlights its effectiveness in real-world applications, showcasing our ability to deliver precise and actionable environmental insights to our clients.By integrating environmental insights into proposals, we showcase our commitment to sustainability, reinforcing Amaris Consulting as a trusted leader in our clients’ sustainability journey and in promoting a low-carbon economy.
## Looking ahead
As we celebrate this significant achievement, we plan to make the methodology behind Carbon Brainprint open source. This move aims to set industry standards within the consulting sector and encourage broader adoption of more precise carbon footprint calculations for intellectual services.
The ISO 14067 verification of Carbon Brainprint is a significant achievement for Amaris Consulting. It highlights our commitment to sustainability and sets the stage for future innovations in sustainability. We look forward to continuing our journey towards a more sustainable future and supporting our clients in their sustainability ambitions.
