# Advancing Workplace Equality: Amaris Consulting France’s 2025 Gender Equality Index Results
In accordance with the Law of September 5, 2018, on the freedom to choose one’s professional future, Amaris Consulting France is pleased to share the results of our 2025 Gender Equality Index, based on data from 2024. This law, designed to promote professional equality between women and men, requires companies with more than 50 employees to publish annual indicators measuring pay gaps and the efforts made to close them.
The Gender Equality Index provides a structured framework for assessing various criteria, assigning a score out of 100 points. Beyond serving as a benchmark, this score helps organizations identify areas for improvement and implement strategies to foster workplace equality.
### Our Results

We are proud to have achieved a total score of 93 out of 100 on the Gender Equality Index. This result reflects our ongoing commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace while motivating us to continue advancing gender equality within our organization.
