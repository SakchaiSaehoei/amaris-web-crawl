# Collaboration Platforms
Collaborative platforms, sometimes known as ‘social software’, integrates work processes with broad social networking. It provides a virtual space not only to store documents and files, but also to collaborate and enhance organizational culture.
Increasingly, workers are looking for flexibility from employers. Organizations must therefore prepare for mounting expectations surrounding remote or hybrid working and freelance arrangements.
One of the major challenges of a distributed workforce is keeping channels of communication open. Collaborative social platforms provide the ideal solution for staying in touch and up to date with your teams around the world, allowing co-workers to share business related information within the parameters of the business’ infrastructure while still being social.
Amaris Consulting is a Microsoft Gold Partner with a team of 30+ experts working with SharePoint and Office 365.
