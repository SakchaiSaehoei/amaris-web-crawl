Clément’s role as a project manager in France highlights the vital part consultants play. Working on projects with international teams across Korea, Brazil, and beyond, Clément manages cross-border collaboration daily.
“ _As a project manager, I work on complex processes with many international stakeholders. In the morning, I have calls with people from Korea, and in the afternoon, with people from Brazil. Compared to my previous experience, 90% of my meetings are in English. It’s challenging, but I see it as a great opportunity._ ”
