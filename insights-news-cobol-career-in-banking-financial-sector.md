What if your next mission powered millions of daily transactions? Far from being outdated, the COBOL language remains a strategic pillar of the global economy, particularly in the financial sector. This timeless language represents a rare and essential expertise, full of opportunities for consultants ready to tackle exciting challenges.
## **COBOL: At the heart of global financial transactions**
Every day, millions of banking transactions rely on COBOL. ATM withdrawals, card payments, insurance claims, and loans—these daily actions are powered by this enduring language. Designed for stability and performance, COBOL is critical for managing high-stakes financial systems where reliability is non-negotiable.
> “W _hat we do in our work has a massive impact on people. It’s rewarding to know that our lines of code make payments possible_.”
> – Jérémy, Consultant at Amaris Consulting
## **A highly sought-after skill in a competitive market**
The COBOL language is still a cornerstone for major financial institutions like banks and insurance companies, which invest heavily in modernizing their systems. Its scarcity creates high demand for skilled consultants. Learning COBOL today guarantees a career in a dynamic, well-paying field.
“ _I had no idea what COBOL was before starting my career. It’s not a hard language to learn, and the opportunities it offers are huge_.” – mentioned Jérémy

## **A dynamic and stimulating daily life**
Working in the COBOL sector is about more than coding. It’s about solving technical challenges, collaborating with business teams, and contributing to projects that touch millions of users. Here’s a glimpse of what the job entails:
  * Developing and testing critical programs.
  * Analyzing client needs to design tailored solutions.
  * Managing complex incidents—like the time a consultant solved an issue that disrupted ATMs across an entire country.
