# Network Optimization (4G/5G QoS, Enterprise SD-Wan, Virtualization)
With the growing number of applications and rising number of demands being placed on the internet, networks play a crucial role in every aspect of our digital lives. This trend is becoming even more prominent due to the spread of COVID-19, requiring corporations to transition toward remote work and deploy optimal measures for high-quality and reliable performance.
This scenario makes network optimization a key element to ensure the sufficiency and security of the information system management. This should be considered as an ongoing process for every network operator to deliver best-in-class service and experience to end-users as well as to optimize business metrics.
