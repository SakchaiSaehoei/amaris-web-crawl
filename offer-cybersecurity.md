# Cybersecurity
Today’s business environment is one of heightened security in the face of frequent cyber-attacks. To remain protected against cyber threats, companies must find a partner who can help to mitigate these risks.
The fight against hackers is an unfair one: a lack of cyber-security expertise and IT skills means that companies are never certain of their readiness for a cyber-attack. 40% of businesses that experience a critical IT failure (e.g. data leaks, breaches) go out of business within one year, meaning cyber security is now a top business priority.
Hackers also have seemingly limitless resources, and sophisticated, multi-stage hacks are becoming harder to detect due to constantly evolving attack methods.
Security audits and forensic analysis must be performed to prevent attacks that could damage connected systems and compromise your company’s information. All organizations with systems connected to the Internet must prioritize cybersecurity if they hope to avoid the economic and reputational damage a cyber-attack brings.
