# The Software Testers of Tomorrow
![software testers](https://amaris.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Software-Testers-of-Tomorrow-1024x724.png)
At this point, we can agree that the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated digital transformation. By driving companies to become 100% digital and changing the way we work and interact, our reliance on applications and software increased. This is an exciting time for the software testing field as it’s evolving to keep pace with market demand.
## The growing momentum for software testers
Today, software testing is considered an integral part of the development of any computer program as it ensures high performance, reliability and security. This leads to great benefits such as cost-effectiveness, time savings, and optimal user experiences.
But what exactly is software testing? To put simply, it refers to the evaluation and verification that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. While programmers design the software architecture of the application, software testing engineers work in parallel to guarantee the products functionality by preventing bugs.
In search of a technological edge, companies are adopting new technologies and testing tools to push the boundaries of quality assurance. According to [**Technavio’s**](https://www.technavio.com/report/software-testing-services-market-share-industry-analysis) report, the global software testing services market size will grow by 55.76 billion (USD) from 2022 to 2026. With the demand for software testers expected to [**grow**](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-6) by 25% over the next eight years, it is surprising that the **[Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/testing/) **survey found that 44% of teams had less than one quality assurance tester per ten developers.
## Challenges continue to intensify
In the field of software testing there is currently a gap between what is needed and what is available: leaving around 40 million technical jobs **[unfulfilled](https://codesubmit.io/blog/shortage-of-developers/) **due to a lack of skilled talent. The new shift towards software testing has resulted in new testing trends, making it difficult for companies to incorporate well-structured training programs as the material quickly becomes outdated.
The difficulty of keeping up with the latest technological developments adds to the **[challenge](https://www.ag5.com/the-challenge-of-upskilling-employees/#four-challenges-of-upskilling-employees)s **organizations are facing as it requires continuous investment in training and development.
## Closing the loop
In the light of the above considerations, the Software Testing Academy was created with the goal to solve these emerging challenges.
The academy offers tailor-made training courses and develops learning tools for its students. This provides future software testers with the right set of practical and up-to-date skills to meet the market demands.
The methodology is based on agile learning which emphasizes the need to treat each student individually. This approach provides training opportunities for students at different stages of their lives and careers. With training materials and resources tailored to the individual needs of each trainee and a flexible learning platform, different levels of knowledge are covered.
To bring this idea to life, Amaris Consulting led the implementation of the e-learning platform and resources and co-manages the development of training materials and tools. By organizing on-site staff training and participating in the implementation of online courses on a global scale, Amaris Consulting ensures that an optimal level of training is provided.
Amaris Consulting leveraged its software expertise – as well as its partnerships – to provide effective communication and disseminate the project strategy.
At Amaris Consulting, we help companies in all R&D phases, from design to prototype. Learn more about our [**solutions**](https://amaris.com/business-line/engineering/#research-development-design)!
