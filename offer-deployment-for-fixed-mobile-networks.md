# Deployment For Fixed & Mobile Networks
Telecommunication operators are at the forefront of digitalizing people’s habits due to the spread of broadband internet access. As potential digital players emerge and successfully develop new business models widely known as the [Over-the-top](https://amaris.com/insights/viewpoint/the-birth-of-6g/) (OTT) services, the market is becoming more competitive, bringing challenges as well as opportunities to the traditional operator’s business.
To meet the growing connectivity demands, CSPs need to invest heavily in growing their network infrastructure, which includes fiber densification, 5G implementation and fixed/mobile network deployment and convergence. Building a robust strategy will enable corporations to implement the best-adapted site, maintain network quality, limit operational expenses, and increase profitability.
