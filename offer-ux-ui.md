# UX/UI
A user interface (UI) is what people interact with when using a digital product or service. It encompasses everything from buttons and icons to screens, sounds, and pages, and is applied across technologies from AR/VR to mobiles and computers. User experience (UX), on the other hand, describes the quality of each encounter a person has with every aspect of a company’s products and services. Digital UX focuses on the nature of a user’s interaction with online assets.
An effective UI/UX delivers business benefits including customer acquisition and retention, lower support requirements, and increased productivity.
