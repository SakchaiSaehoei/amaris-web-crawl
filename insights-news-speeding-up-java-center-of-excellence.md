Amaris Consulting is looking to recruit between 50 and 100 junior and experienced engineers (developers, Scrum Masters, product owners, QA & DevOps profiles) with a master’s degree by 2022.
Discover our interview about our Java Factory with Nicolas Martin, Information Systems & Digital Manager at Amaris Consulting France and [**Guillaume Cassini**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaume-cassini-8241423b/), Experienced Manager – Head of Operations at Sophia Antipolis.
## Can you explain the project in a few words? 
This project aims to accelerate the growth of our **Digital Solutions Center of Excellence in Java** , in order to meet the high demand of some of our French and international clients in the banking and retail sectors.
## What is a Center of Excellence?
A Center of Excellence is primarily a community of experts spread over 5 continents who share and combine their passion, know-how and experience on a given solution or offering (e.g., Software Development).
It is also a transversal organization within Amaris Consulting which aims at capitalizing on knowledge and practices to better support our clients in their projects.
Finally, it allows us to pool our organizational, technical, and human resources. As a result, we have more time to focus exclusively on our clients’ needs and on achieving better results. We are also more responsive in terms of our ability to deliver services faster and thus contribute to reducing our Time to Market.
## Why did you choose Nice Sophia Antipolis?
We have chosen an attractive and pleasant region, which offers many advantages and opportunities.
Nice is the 5th largest city in France and is one of the sunniest cities in Europe. It is only 10 minutes away from Antibes, 20 minutes from Cannes, and 30 minutes from Monaco and the Italian border. As France’s second largest airport, Nice offers direct access to major cities in France and Europe, which makes it a perfect hub for international business.
Sophia-Antipolis is Europe’s leading technology park with a dynamic, technology-oriented market and a high concentration of large companies, start-ups, research centers, schools, and universities.
## What solutions have you implemented to address recruitment challenges?
The French labor market is currently very competitive, especially for Java & J2EE profiles. However, we must also factor in the profound transformations we have experienced since the pandemic, which has forced us to change our work habits.
Hence, we have chosen to recruit our future experts all over the territory. Amaris Consulting is an independent firm whose business is built around its people. We are therefore very responsive and flexible: our information system and our telework policy allow our people to work remotely under excellent working conditions, and our international mobility policy gives those who want to move to another country the necessary support to succeed.
The project’s success also depends on improving our attractiveness through career opportunities that extend beyond simple projects. The Java Factory is fully in line with this objective as it is a “company” that is looking for “intrapreneurs” to contribute to its long-term development by working on various value-added projects in different areas of activity. Moreover, joining Amaris Consulting also provides the opportunity to learn about other technologies and jobs.
Finally, we have also contacted universities, schools, and training organizations in view of creating partnerships that will allow us to help train future graduates and offer them career opportunities as soon as they complete their studies.
