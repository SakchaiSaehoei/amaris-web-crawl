# DevOps
The aim of DevOps is to deliver value faster and safer. DevOps deals with planning, integration and automation of processes related to software development, and the reliable maintenance of a software solution. It integrates software development (Dev) with IT operations (Ops).
## **The importance of DevOps**
DevOps helps to ensure the smooth delivery of services and facilitates better working relationships between the teams building solutions and those who maintain them. It breaks down silo mentalities and enables teams to be proactive, improving reaction times across departments.
As well as improving agility and reducing time-to-market through faster software deployments, DevOps also boosts innovation thanks to reduced cycle times and the ability to keep pace with fast-moving market developments.
Business continuity and end-user satisfaction benefit from DevOps too; up to 80% of outages are caused by system changes. DevOps greatly reduces the likelihood of things going wrong and facilitates faster response times if needed.
