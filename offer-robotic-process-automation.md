# Robotic Process Automation
Companies are coming under increasing pressure to make their business models more efficient. The corresponding surge in digitalization has seen increasing use of digital channels in everything from day-to-day tasks to high-level company management.
Adapting to this new environment is crucial for companies’ survival; the organizations which embrace increasing digitalization will necessarily outperform digital laggards both in terms of customer satisfaction and talent retention. [Robotic process automation (RPA) will be a key differentiator](https://hbr.org/sponsored/2019/12/how-companies-are-using-intelligent-automation-to-be-more-innovative).
## The importance of Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
Thanks to our digitized environment, customers face low barriers when switching service providers. Companies must therefore **generate a good user experience** to retain them. 
To facilitate the improvements required, it is essential for companies to create efficiencies where possible. Reducing human error, increasing operational speed, lowering costs, and freeing up resources to allocate to the most valuable tasks are effective ways of achieving these efficiencies.
In other words, businesses must now automate and systematize low-value tasks to get them done well, quickly, and without the need for human intervention.
Here’s where Robotic Process Automation (RPA) comes to the fore: creating efficiencies and freeing critical human resources to perform higher-value tasks, as well as:
  * Improved competitiveness.
  * Improved efficiency.
  * Reduced percentage of errors.
  * Improved processes, such as a full audit log for auditable tasks.
  * Reduce costs.
  * Increased agility in repetitive tasks.
