# Quality Assurance & Quality Control
To remain competitive and to match [customersâ€™ ever increasing expectations](https://healthcareglobal.com/medical-devices-and-pharma/4-reasons-why-customer-driven-approach-will-increase-pharma-sales), healthcare systems have to make every effort to prevent errors, learn from mistakes, and manifest a culture of safety.
