# Blockchain in Education
![blockchain](https://amaris.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/article-photo-41-1024x683.png)
In Europe, within the educational sphere, there is little standardization of student records. Currently, education received at tertiary level is represented by credits of learning using one of two credit standards, namely ECTS (in Higher Education) or ECVET (in Vocational Education).
All degrees issued within the European Higher Education Area are accompanied by a diploma supplement that describes the degree in standard terms. However, again there are no standards for computer-readable data for diploma supplements. Paper-based higher education diplomas, school certificates and extra training course certificates get misplaced and can be lost over time, while their common digital version can be counterfeited or not easily recognized.
According to the **[Blockchain in Education Report](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur-scientific-and-technical-research-reports/blockchain-education)** , issued in 2017 by the Joint Research Centre (the European Commission’s science and knowledge service), using a blockchain for the automatic recognition and transfer of credits would make a learner’s entire educational history in terms of those credits instantly visible and verifiable.
## Project objectives
**The TRUE project aims to develop an integrated training strategy for the uptake of blockchain technology in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) across Europe.**
The project seeks to develop the necessary outputs to implement its solution, such as:
  1. **Baseline knowledge pack** The potential of blockchain technology including a Competence Framework for the Blockchain Expert
  2. **Training contents & tools**Massive open online course (MOOC) on blockchain technology for higher education staff
  3. **Serious games** Providing an innovative learning experience on how the blockchain technology works


## Innovative aspects
The innovative force of TRUE relies on its targeted approach of blockchain deployment for higher education purposes, resulting in the use of such technological infrastructure to secure the circulation of verified learning transcripts, diplomas and academic credits, thus enhancing transparency between HEIs, students and third parties. 
**The aim of TRUE is not to deliver “yet another course” on the basics of blockchain** (rich in high-level theoretical and technical discourse and poor in practical input and scenarios), **but to explore how HEIs can make it work for them and the resources/opportunities implied through an innovative and comprehensive educational pathway.**
To reach this outcome, the consortium will lay down a new competence profile on blockchain particularly targeted at HEIs professionals and their needs, with those same competences materialized in a comprehensive MOOC and enriched through the effective learning experience of a serious game.
## Expected impacts
  * Improving the competencies of professional staff at Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in relation to blockchain technology and its benefits
  * Higher awareness among HEIs staff and decision makers about the potential for deploying blockchain technology for administrative procedures
  * Firmer push from students towards the adoption of blockchain-based procedures for the automatic recognition of their learning records
  * Broader circulation of blockchain knowledge in EU academic and professional contexts, leading to the creation of a common shared base


## Amaris Consulting’s role in the project
**Amaris Consulting** will contribute its expertise in delivering blockchain training courses for private companies. Building from these experiences and success cases, we will be responsible for the development of the serious game, coordinating all the contributions from other partners and guaranteeing a high level of innovation and effectiveness. 
In addition, we will contribute to the training content development and to the collection of external feedback. We will host the Summer School, welcoming staff members from every partner for a 3-day ‘train the trainer’ activity. 
Holding branches in more than 60 countries around the world, our dissemination effort will be remarkable at international level, but also at national level, with the organization of the Multiplier Event for France.
